CMSC 624: Assignment 1

In this assignment, you will get some hands-on experience exploring the performance and architectural differences between database system process models. The main challenge of this assignment will be to understand existing code that we are providing you. By reading though this code, we hope you will get a sense of some of the basic implementation differences between thread-based and process-based process models. The amount of code you have to write for this assignment is quite small. In short, we are providing implementations of thread-per worker and process-per-worker process models (see chapter two of the "Architecture of a Database System" paper that is in the assigned reading for this semester) over a simple database stored as an array in main memory. Your goal in this assignment is to implement the process-pool and thread-pool variants of these process models. Even for these variants, we have written most of the code for you --- we have just left the most interesting parts of the code left for you to implement. However, if you do not understand the thread-per worker and process-per-worker code that we have provided you, you will likely be unable to add the missing code (even though it is small) for the thread-pool and process-pool variants.

Aside from writing code, this assignment involves running some performance experiments, and answering some questions we ask below.

This assignment --- especially the performance experiments --- should be performed on heave2 using an account that should have been created for you there. 
You can code/debug the assignment on any machine you have access to. But please run your official set of performance experiments on heave2.
You will submit the assignment to ELMs via the instructions found there.

Execution models --
The assignment uses linux's pthreads to implement the
thread-per-request and thread-pool models. http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialPosixThreads.html provides a good
reference for programming with pthreads on linux.
The assignment codebase only uses pthreads for managing threads' lifecycles
(thread creation and deletion). Inter-thread synchronization is
mediated via semaphores (see below), _not_ pthread mutexes and signals.

The process-per-request and process-pool models are implemented using
linux processes. Processes communicate with each other using shared memory
segments via mmap'ed pages. (The provided database class
implementation has a few example uses of mmap -- see
below).

Synchronization --
This assignment uses semaphores to mediate inter-thread and
inter-process communication. Semaphores are usually covered (at least theoretically) in intro to systems programming courses. We recommend you read through
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2008/Notes/threads-semaphores.txt for some background on semaphores if you have not seen them in the past.

WARNING: Semaphores are a critical part of this assignment. You will
struggle without a basing understanding of the concepts outlined in
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2008/Notes/threads-semaphores.txt.

Codebase --
The include/utils.h file contains several flags you may find useful
for correctly initializing mmap'ed pages and semaphores.

The assignment models a database processing requests that manipulate
several records.

The database consists of an array of 1000-byte-sized records. The
database exports three important functions: get_record,
lock_record, and unlock_record. get_record returns a reference to a
record. lock_record and unlock_record serve as mutex-locks, giving the
calling process or thread exclusive access to a particular record.

Each request updates several records in the database. In order to run
a request, a process or thread calls a request's execute function in
order to process it.

Launcher is the base class from which each execution
model will derive (process_pool_launcher, process_launcher,
thread_pool_launcher, and thread_launcher). Each of these classes
override the launcher's execute_request function.

Your task is to complete the implementations of the
process_pool_launcher, and thread_pool_launcher classes. Look for
"YOUR CODE HERE" annotations in the comments in
src/process_pool_launcher.cc and src/thread_pool_launcher.cc. As mentioned above, we have
provided implementations of the process-per-request, and
thread-per-request execution models in process_launcher.cc, and
thread_launcher.cc, respectively. You should use these implementations as
references while building your thread-pool, and process-pool
implementations.

The pool-based schemes (thread- and process-pools) take a "pool size"
parameter as input (specified in their constructors). The parameter is
used to limit the maximum number of threads and processes available to
execute requests.

The non-pool-based schemes (thread- and process-per-request) take a
"max outstanding" parameter as input (again, specified in their
constructors). This parameter is used to limit the maximum number of
in-flight requests at any given time.

The "pool size" and "max outstanding" parameters above are specified
as command-line arguments, and will be used to measure the relative
performance of each of the four execution models.

The provided makefile will compile your executable into build/db. The
executable takes parameters --exp_type, --max_outstanding, and
--pool_size. Each of these three parameters take _integers_ as
arguments. The command-line parsing code is not robust enough to deal
with incorrectly specified parameter arguments!

--exp_type specifies the type of execution model.
0 -- PROCESS_POOL
1 -- PROCESS_PER_REQUEST
2 -- THREAD_POOL
3 -- THREAD_PER_REQUEST

If you wish to test your process- or thread-pool implementations,
specify the appropriate argument to exp_type and additionally specify
a pool size (as an integer).

If you wish to test your process- or thread-per-request
implementations, specify the appropriate argument to exp_type and
additionally specify the number of max_outstanding requests.

The executable will run for about a minute, and measure the throughput
(requests per second) of the specified execution model. The measured
throughput is written to a file, "results.txt".

We have also provided code to test each of your implementations. In
order to run a test, run the appropriately configured execution
model with the --test option. If provided with the --test option, the
executable will check for correctness using a serial execution model.
Running your code with the --test option will not measure throughput.

Finally, you will need to report measurements for running requests
under varying levels of conflicts between requests. Two requests conflict if they they try to access the same record in the database. We have provided a
--contention option to induce conflicts among transactions. To
run an experiment under high contention (lots of conflicts), add the
--contention flag as an argument to the executable. Experiments run
under low contention (few conflicts) without the --contention flag.

If a pair of requests conflict, then one of the requests block while
the other makes progress. Thus, under high contention, we would expect
requests to block each other frequently. On the other hand, under low
contention, the probability of two requests blocking due to a conflict
is very low.

Please put “killall build/db” in your test scripts, otherwise
the processes that were spun off by the assignment will result in hundreds of
zombie processes on machines. If you could please log into the junkfood machines
that you were using and make sure that you have killed any db processes that you started,
this would allow us to be good citizens, and avoid angering the admins.
We have provided test scripts (lowcontention.sh and highcontention.sh) that you can use, and you can make any changes you want for your own tests.
Those scripts already have “killall build/db” in them.

Hints --
The header files corresponding to the four execution models contain
the appropriate structures for communication between the main launcher
thread, and processes/threads used to execute requests.

The thread- and process-pools are managed via a free-list. Each
process or thread has a corresponding process_state or thread_state
struct (include/process_pool_launcher.h and
include/thread_pool_launcher.h). These structs are linked together
into a free-list, which is used to indicate whether or not a process
is currently in use.

Deliverables --
- Compiled and working code for the process-pool, and thread-pool
execution models. We will evaluate your code using the --test option
described above. Each execution model will be tested at pool sizes
of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128. Note that passing
these test cases is the only way to earn credit for your code. We will
award no points for code that does not pass _all_ test cases.
There are 64 public tests that will test your code for correctness.
The submit server expects a zip file with the include/ and src/ directories.

The submit server has 64 release tests which you will need to manually trigger once your code is tested.
These will run the experiments for each configuration and output the throughput for each one. Note that
these tests _will_ fail-- that's okay. The tests are only there to output the throughput for each case.
Running the release tests to get the throughput experiments will take a long time (about 2 hours)
Please _only_ run these tests if your code passes all public tests.

================================================================================
20 points for each execution model. Total 40 points.
================================================================================

- For each execution model, report throughput while varying the pool
size or the maximum outstanding requests parameter. You must report
throughput for all four execution models (process-per-request,
thread-per-request, thread-pool, and process-pool). Measure throughput
at the following parameter values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128].
As mentioned above, we have provided test scripts (lowcontention.sh and
highcontention.sh) which varies all of these parameters for you.

Report these throughput measurements under both high contention and
low contention in text files "high-contention.txt" and
"low-contention.txt" respectively.

Each line of the file should begin with the name of the execution model, and the
list of measured throughput values (in increasing order of pool size
or max outstanding requests). For example:
process_pool 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 ...

- Provide a brief explanation (between three to four paragraphs) for
the throughput trends you observe in a separate file,
"responses.txt". In particular, explain the differences between each
process model --- why do some models get higher throughput than other models? Which process model is the fastest and why is it the fastest? Which one is slowest and why is it slowest? Why are the ones in the middle slower/faster than the two at the extremes? How and why does throughout change as the maximum number of outstanding requests or pool size change? In addition, explain the differences between high-contention and low-contention experiments.

================================================================================
44 points for performance results / analysis
================================================================================

Finally, answer each of the following questions briefly
(at most two paragraphs per question) in "responses.txt".

Questions --
1) The process-pool implementation must copy a request into a process'
request buffer. The process-per-request implementation, however, does
not need to copy or pass requests between processes. Why?

2) The process-pool implementation requires a request to be copied
into a process-local buffer before the request can be executed. On the
other hand, the thread-pool implementation can simply use a pointer to
the appropriate request. Why?

================================================================================
8 points for each response. Total 16 points.
